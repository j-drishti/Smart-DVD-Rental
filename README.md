# Smart-DVD-Rental
DVD rental system modeled on a schema that consists of information- including but not limited to the movie inventory, the associated cast details, the employees, admin, investor and customers' checkouts. The relational database allows for easy rentals and employee management. Apart from that, it leverages payment handling with features like late fines, renewals etc. It incorporates Machine Learning algorithms to recommend movies to the users based on previous rentals; all encompassed in a user-friendly ensemble that enables easy acquisitions and returns. To further enhance this, each employee of the store has limited access to the database which is superseded by the admin. We query the database to analyze how different customer bases employ the application and its impact on the store earnings and movie patterns. We have deployed hashing to prevent SQL injection as added security.
